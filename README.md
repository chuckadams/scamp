# scamp

This was to kick off a haskell roguelike project.  Right now you can move an `@` around the screen, and not even on a grid.  Yay.

## External Dependencies

* SDL
* SDL_ttf

On MacOS with homebrew, both dependencies can be installed with `brew install sdl sdl_ttf`.  MacOS Mojave (10.14) or later requires SDL 2.09 or higher, otherwise you will see only a blank screen.
